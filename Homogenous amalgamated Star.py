#1. AdjacencyList is the best data-structure to represent / store the graph in memory. 

#2. Answer is Code

#3. The Greedy Design Strategy is well-suited for this task. By assigning labels step-by-step, beginning with the main center, then moving to the star centers, and finally to the pendants, the algorithm effectively creates unique labels that meet adjacency constraints. This method keeps computation per node low, allowing for efficient labeling without the need to continually re-check previously assigned labels.

#4. Depth-First Search (DFS) is ideal here because it explores each star subgraph completely before moving to the next, closely matching the structure of a star-centered graph and efficiently handling pendant connections.

#5. Labels: [1, [1, 3, 5, 7], [2, 7, 9, 11], [4, 11, 13, 14], [6, 14, 16, 18], [9, 16, 18, 19], [11, 18, 19, 20], [13, 19, 20, 21], [15, 20, 21, 22], [18, 20, 21, 22], [20, 21, 22, 23], [22, 22, 23, 24], [25, 22, 23, 24]]
    # Edge Weights: [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 19, 21, 23, 26, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49] 48

#7. CPU can handle approximately 10,000 vertices and associated edges. Beyond this, performance may slow significantly, with memory constraints impacting computations as V and E increase.

#8. Time Complexity:

#Vertex Labeling: O(V) , as each vertexâ€™s label is assigned without revisiting others.
#Edge Weight Assignment: O(E), each edge is assigned a weight in a straightforward pass.
#Total Complexity: O(V * E), which is efficient for large sparse graphs.

#Since each vertex and edge is processed once, the complexity remains linear, making it efficient for graph sizes within hardware capabilities.
